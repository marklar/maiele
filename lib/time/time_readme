This lib's only purpose is for use in creating a top level of the Maiele environment.
The build_toplevel script will add the time.cma library into the top level and use it
to replace the conflicting annexlib. All of the compiled resources are included and
should not ever need to be compiled again, but if it needs to be compiled again for
any reason you can follow these commands

in the lib directory:
ocamlc -c time.mli
ocamlc -c time.ml
ocamlc -c time_stubs.c
ocamlmklib -o time_stubs time_stubs.o
ocamlc -a -custom time.cma time.cmo -dllib dlltime_stubs.so
